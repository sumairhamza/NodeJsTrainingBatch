   <p> I’ve been a developer, teacher and currently a business owner working from home. I believe no matter what you’re 
       currently doing, being productive is what matters the most. So here are the seven things I applied that helped me 
       got more productive while working from home. 
    </p>

<h3>1. CREATE A WORK ENVIRONMENT AT HOME.</h3>

<p>So the first thing is to create a working environment at home. The beauty about I.T is that you can immediately start working 
anywhere by just having a table, chair, a cup of hot coffee and your laptop. So just pick a spot at your home where you’re 
comfortable sitting at. I would prefer your own room or a room that’s some privacy or less disturbances, so place a table, 
chair and that hot coffee I was talking about. </p> 

<h3>2. SCHEDULE YOURSELF. </h3>

<p>If you really want to be productive, schedule yourself. Get an App, keep a diary, write on your whiteboard but always plan your day before it begins. I create daily schedules early morning, this helps me organize my day and by doing less I achieve more. You’ll understand that we have a lot of time to get our things done, and that’s because we stop wasting our time and utilize it properly. Some of the tasks I add in my day </p>
<ol>
    <li>Check on with John Doe regarding updates on projects. </li>
    <li>Practice your Node.js training classes. </li>
    <li>Meetup with John Doe at 8:00 PM.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can even add your time meeting with friends, going out for a dinner or having a party because you need to relax sometime and this too can help you be more productive. </p>

<h3>TALK YOUR FAMILY / FRIENDS WHO LIVE WITH YOU.</h3>

<p>Ok this part is the tricky one. Usually when you’re working at home; your friends / family tend to think you’re just chilling in your room and they would disturb you with small petty household work such as taking out the trash, see who’s at the door, or “Son can you help me with this box on the top shelf”. Although it’s good to lend a hand with household chores but you have to understand and make them realize YOU’RE WORKING ! Make them understand that the moment it’s 10:00 AM and you go into your workplace you’re not home anymore. You can’t help them with the household things because that kills your productivity. Specially being a developer if you’re working on a project and concentrating on some piece of code, when all of a sudden someone asks you to throw the trash immediately kills your productivity. </p>

<h3>4. DOWNLOAD THE RIGHT APPLICATIONS.</h3>

<p>When you’re working from home, it’s most likely that you’re involved in a team who’re working remotely from different parts of the world. Communication is key when it comes to complete a project and your client is waiting for you to give him the update or deliver the product before the deadline. So I’ve listed some applications that I use everyday to help me get things done with my team. </p>

<ol>
<li>For Team Messaging: <a href="#">Slack</a></li>
<li>For music: <a href="#">SoundCloud</a></li> 
<li>For personal task management and goals for the day: <a href="#">Momentum</a></li>
<li>For project Management: <a href="#">Asana</a></li>
<li>For video / audio calls: <a href="#">Skype</a></li>
</ol>
<h3>5. STRONG MINDSET. </h3>
<p>This may be the most important feature of them all. You need to have a strong mindset when working from home, remember you’re all alone in this struggle and there will come times when things wont be going as you thought they would be. There’re always highs and lows in life specially when you’re 
    in a home office environment. So make a life goal and if being at home helps you lower your expenses then go for it. </p>
